        <h2>Who is he? </h2>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who was characterized by his expressionist style and use of bright, vivid colors. His work is recognized for the emotional intensity it conveys and his innovative technique. Although during his lifetime he did not achieve great recognition, his work has been widely valued and studied in the art world.</p>

        <h2>Wheat Field with Crows, 1890 </h2>
        <p>This is the last canvas that Vincent van Gogh painted. The painter depicts a wheat field under a restless sky, due to the strength of the brushstrokes of varied blues. Something like celestial lights are glimpsed without much clarity and merge with the atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>The Potato Eaters, 1885</h2>
        <p>Accustomed as we are to Van Gogh's popular colorful paintings, The Potato Eaters surprises us. With an earthy and almost baroque palette, Van Gogh depicts the scene of a peasant family sharing the potatoes they have grown themselves at dinner. He has done what previous artists did not do: he has "removed make-up" from the characters, he has shown them in their rudeness and in their difference.</p>

    <h2>The Starry Night, 1889</h2>
    <p>This is, without a doubt, the author's most emblematic painting. The sky of that starry night is fixed in the memory of those who see it. It is a luminous fantasy, a mobile, distorted, dynamic reality, which rather than floating, seems to advance in undulating lines on the verticality and constructive geometry that inhabits the city.</p>
